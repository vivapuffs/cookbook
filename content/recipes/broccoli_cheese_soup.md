<h2>Notes</h2>
I have had the most success with using Kirkland brand cheddar cheese. I find grocery store brands (like Black Diamond) don't melt very well and tend to clump at the bottom of the pot. Cubed potatoes (added in after the milk and mustard, before the cheese) as well as bacon bits go great with this soup.
