<div><b>Servings:</b> at least 4</div>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
  <li>2 onions</li>
  <li>1 head roast garlic</li>
  <li>1 bell pepper (red, orange, or yellow will work)</li>
  <li>1 carrot</li>
  <li>3 cups spinach leaves</li>
  <li>450g chicken thigh</li>
  <li>3 teaspoons ginger (1 tablespoon minced/grated fresh ginger is fine as well)</li>
  <li>800mL coconut milk (should be about 2 cans)</li>
  <li>3 tablespoons thai red curry paste (i like mae ploy brand. do not get thai kitchen brand it is ass)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>pour the coconut milk into a pot. set the pot to low heat and stir occasionally. you are looking for the milk to thicken up</li>
  <li>slice the onions into thin strips, shred the carrot (use a cheese grater) and slice the pepper into strips. set aside.</li>
  <li>slice the chicken into thin strips, about the size of 2 of your pepper slices. set aside.</li>
  <li>heat a large pan (or wok) on medium heat and add the butter. add the onions and cook until they are semi translucent. if you have the patience, go until they've browned a bit - the flavour is worth the wait in my opinion</li>
  <li>add the chicken and cook until chicken is no longer raw (about 5 minutes.)</li>
  <li>add the garlic and ginger, and cook until fragrant (about 1 minute.)</li>
  <li>add the coconut milk from the pot, the curry paste, the carrots, and the peppers. bring mixture to a simmer, and let simmer for 5 minutes.</li>
  <li>taste the curry and add salt, sugar, and/or additional curry paste to your liking.</li>
  <li>add the spinach and cook until it starts to wilt (about 2 minutes.)</li>
</ol>

<h2>Notes</h2>
you could probably subsitute the chicken for beef or fish and it'd still be good.
