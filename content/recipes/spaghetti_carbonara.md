<h2>Recipe Info</h2>
<div><b>Servings:</b>2-3</div>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>3 strips bacon (don't cheap out on the bacon. get thick cut)</li>
  <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
  <li>1 egg</li>
  <li>25g grated parmesean (DO NOT GET PRESHREDDED I AM SERIOUS EVEN MORE SERIOUS THAN WHEN I SAID NOT TO CHEAP OUT ON THE BACON)</li>
  <li>255g spaghetti</li>
  <li>good quality salt (optional, for sprinkling on top after)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>grate 25g of parmesean into a bowl. crack an egg into the bowl and beat together with a fork. this is the sauce</li>
  <li>mince garlic and set aside.</li>
  <li>bring a pot of water to a boil and add in the spaghetti. cook to package instructions, strain when done cooking</li>
  <li>cut bacon into small pieces (bite size). put into a pan large enough to fit all of the spaghetti in it and cook on medium-low</li>
  <li>when the bacon is about 3 minutes from being cooked, add the garlic to the pan. turn the heat off once the garlic is cooked</li>
  <li>add the strained pasta to the pan. stir to combine</li>
  <li>this part is a bit tricky - if you have a laser thermometer, you want the pasta to be at ~65°C when adding the sauce. otherwise you're just gonna have to eyeball it, if the pasta is too hot, it will cook the eggs and you will have scambled egg pasta</li>
  <li>serve and optionally add salt on top</li>
</ol>
